  gem in bundler #Â if necessary
  bundle install
  rackup app.ru

  ruby client.rb # in another shell

Listens on localhost:9292 by default, and proxies servers as defined in
config.yml (looked up using the key provided by the client).


DATABASE BRANCH

Moved config to a simple database, just to see what difference a database query

Prerequisites:

* sqlite3 (or edit database.yml to use a different database)
* sqlite3-ruby gem (or appropriate gem for database)

Setup:

  ruby schema.rb
  ruby load_data.rb
